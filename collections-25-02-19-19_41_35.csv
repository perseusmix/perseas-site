Transliteration after Masson 1966. The text is described as Eteo-Cypriot because it cannot be read and even the beginning of the text is uncertain (Masson 1966, 28).","The alabastron was discovered or collected by Luigi Palma di Cesnola but ended up in Lang's personal collection where it remained until 1903. When Lang left Cyprus in 1872, he gave around 1500 fragmentary items to Cesnola in exchange for a dozen pieces of high quality (BM GR archives, Original Letters 1869-72, vol. 2). This is possibly one of these exchanges, though it was commonplace for the antiquarian community to give or swap items from their excavations and collections, and Lang says that he ceded Cesnola the right to excavate at Golgoi so he may have been given items from the site before this time.  
The inscription was published in various places since its discovery: by Cesnola (1877, pl. IV, 17); Cesnola 1885-1903, III, Supplement, pl. CXLI, no. 15; Schmidt 1874, 100; Schmidt 1876, 7 and pl. XIX, 1; Hall 1885,  226ff. See also Mitford 1961, p. 45 no. 30.

Neither the direction of the script nor the linguistic affinity of the text could be established by Masson but it appears to be definitely not Greek and has therefore been defined as Eteo-Cypriot by default (Masson 1966, 29).","Two old Egyptian Department registration numbers are written on the body of the vessel (98333 on the neck and, more faintly, 89330 between the lugs).
The alabastron was discovered or collected by Luigi Palma di Cesnola but ended up in personal Lang's collection where it remained until 1903. When Lang left Cyprus in 1872, he gave around 1500 fragmentary items to Cesnola in exchange for a dozen pieces of high quality (BM GR archives, Original Letters 1869-72, vol. 2). This is possibly one of these exchanges, through it was commonplace for the antiquarian community to give or swap items from their excavations and collections, and Lang says that he ceded Cesnola the right to excavate at Golgoi so he may have been given items from the site before this time

See Nicolaou 1976, 169-181 and fig. 10 for other tombs in this cemetery found in more recent times. Also Fourrier 2015 for a more recent overview of the topography of the town. 
See the comments of the excavator Max Ohnefalsch-Richter (1893, pl. 155,9). Benton (1961, 50 and pl. IV,3) identified the birds as turtle-doves and the square structure as a flower pot, not an altar as stated in the BM Vase Catalogue.

The species of marine animals represented is/are uncertain: sharks, dophins and tunny fish have been suggested based on various details, as well as the red mullet (see Crouwel and Morris 1987, 45-6; see Gill 1985). It is possible however that no one species was intended by the artist or that an intended one was not rendered with sufficient accuracy to permit identification.

The tomb also contained other Pictorial Style vessels, much gold jewellery, ivory figurines, several alabaster vessels and a haematite cylinder seal. Johnson attributed a Pictorial Style krater with an octopus/cuttlefish (GR 1898,12-1.319) and a conical seal GR 1898,2-25.2 to this tomb  which she suggests was found at British Museum Site C (i.e. Maroni-Vournes – se Cadogan 1992). 
Both the attribution and tomb location are however incorrect. While the present item was said to be found with a crater decorated with cuttlefish, it is far from clear if this is the same as GR 1898,12-1.319 which was registered in the same sequence as the finds from the BM excavation. Purchased items would normally be indicated as such and registered in a separate group. In this particular instance, Murray was adamant in his reply to Christian that this tomb group must be sold Furthermore, the only gem mentioned in Percy Christian's letter to Murray recording the discovery of the tomb and its contents was a haematite cylinder seal (GR archives, Original Letters, 26 February 1898); the seal Johnson attributed to this tomb was actually purchased by the BM from a dealer in a separate transaction. In general, it is difficult to identify the items from the tomb listed in the vendor's letter in the BM collection apart from the chariot crater. In the 1898,12-1 sequence there are a number of items - mainly sherds of Mycenaean pictorial style pottery - that were not assigned to tombs, so some could in principle be among those mentioned in Christian's tomb group (such as one showing rather odd drawn animals, apparently lions which may be the ‘goats’ mentioned in his letter – though this seems unlikely). At the same time, the BM expedition found fragments of chariot vases at both sites B and C so these could account for the corresponding pieces in the group with tomb numbers. It is quite possible that, for some reason, the museum did not in fact buy the complete tomb group, possibly because it had acquired similar objects in the excavations at Marni (but also at Enkomi the previous year).   
As for the location of the tomb itself, this is explicitly said in a letter to Walters the previous day (op. cit.) to have been found '1/2 mile from the place called Bamboula & Vournes in a N. Westerly direction' which seems to correspond with the Kapsaloudhia areas (Cadogan 1992, 125-6). Johnson perhaps based her supposition on the fact that the BM had discovered fragments of vases with chariot scenes at their Site C (Vournes) and Site B (which Johnson placed on the eastern edge of Vournes, but judging by the distances cited, this is in fact further away).

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum’s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide.; Fairbanks gives Naukratis as the findspot, but the provenance is not assured.
Although this piece is most likely not from Naukratis itself, it nevertheless belongs with a number of other finely executed aryballoi, which form a distinct group within the sixth century faience industry. It is one of a range of mixed-style heads which have very finely observed features, and which display details of modelling which link them closely to the conventions of Saite sculpture. The best comparison is the glazed composition Achelous head aryballos from Kawa in Nubia, now Oxford Ashmolean, 1931.482. (Webb 1978, no 845; Boardman 1999, fig. 148, 127.) This displays the same shaped hair-line as the Boston piece, a shape which was considered typical of the black African, for it imitates the hair line of a closely shaven head, and  can also be seen on some of the moulds from the scarab factory at Naukratis, though in cruder form. (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, nos 8 & 9; Gorton fig.35, nos. 2 and 3 in top line.) However, since this second piece (from Kawa in Nubia) represents the bull-headed river god Achelous, the hair line is stretched right down to the beard and neck.  The modelling of the face, particularly the eyes, is very subtle, and like our Boston head, can only find adequate comparisons with Saite sculpture (Bothmer 1960, figs. 65-67, pls. 28-9, and passim.) Other features are the elongated, almond shaped eyes, with projecting cosmetic lines at the outer corners, while the perforation holes at either side of the mouth have parallels with both Egyptian sculpture (Dows Dunham 1950, Canopic head vase, Ku 16. 19.3, 573, pl. 37, F.) and Egyptian contemporary work in glass (Journal of Glass Studies, 2 (1960), fig. 14, p. 22-3.)
Other related pieces, also with depictions of  black African heads, are the glazed composition vases in the form of a Nubian and a Syrian head, back to back (Webb 1978, nos. 874, 875). However, these are not such finely modelled studies, although there is the same hair line, here with the addition of internal detail represented as of African type with incised squares/diamonds and a central dot in each cell. One of the two wears circular earrings, as suspected for the Boston piece (Webb 1978, 875, pl. XX) and facial features are similarly if more crudely represented.
 Other pieces can also be compared with our black African head- a group of vases where a girl's head is combined with various monsters. (Webb 1978, 131, nos 880-883.) These include (in the depiction of the girl) cosmetic lines on the eyes, a mouth with perforations at either corner, and carefully modelled ears. There is also a series of helmeted head aryballoi. (Webb 1978, nos. 840-844) which similarly have almond shaped eyes, and charmingly combine Greek-style helmets with Egyptian decoration.
To sum up,  the Boston aryballos in the form of the head of a Black African belongs with a finely modelled group of head vases, which are part of the sixth century faience aryballoi industry, and demonstrate close links with Egyptian sculpture of the Saite period. They are distributed in both Egypt, Cyprus, Rhodes, Aigina, and Italy as well as probable Black Sea sites.We should not be wrong in assigning these to  workshops established in a part of Egypt where Greek influence was strong, but was willingly mixed with local traditions, and where trading links with the Mediterranean were vibrant.  
Unfortunately, we have no dated contexts for any of these aryballoi. We can only suggest that there are stylistic links with the cartouched aryballoi, which although they appear to bear the cartouche Wa ib re (Apries) (589-570) may in fact be dated to the second quarter of the sixth century.; Aryballoi in faience are a rare find in Naukratis. Amongst the four hedgehog aryballoi said to come from Naukratis, only BM 1886.0401.1501 can be assuredly assigned to the site (Webb 1978, 133, no. 905, pl. 21), while the provenance of the aryballoi kept in Edinburgh, Copenhagen and New York is highly doubtful (Webb forthcoming). To the British Museum specimen can be added two fragments of spherical aryballoi kept at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (Eg.Inv.3623-3624). 
All these examples of finds actually made on the site of Naukratis demonstrate the poor conditions of preservation which prevailed there -either due to damp and their making up part of what were rubbish dumps in antiquity, or the damage caused by the conditions prevailing in the 1880's when the Sebakhin were extracting the rich soil for fertiliser. Their fragmentary condition makes it even less likely that complete examples  can be assigned a findspot from Naukratis itself, although this does not rule out the possibility of their manufacture there. See the comment on fragmentary hedgehog aryballoi noted by Edgar in piles of rubbish near the scarab factory. (Hogarth 1905, 134). 
Such containers were very popular in the Mediterranean world especially during the 6th century BC and belong to the Phase III in the Archaic Greek Faience typology by Webb (Webb 1978, 133–5; Webb forthcoming; Pierrat-Bonnefois forthcoming). Apart Naukratis, other Egyptian sites provided aryballoi in faience, such as Tell el Yehudiyeh and Thebes (Webb 1978, nos 907–915).

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum’s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide.; For the type, compare the spherical aryballos from Rhodes, British Museum 1860,0201.56  (Webb 1978, p. 109 no. 707, pl.17, 'Early Fine Group, Group 1'). This is a member of the group (Webb 1978, 109-10) with the most elaborate moulding, where almost all the surfaces are decorated. On the concave upper surface of the lip there can be incised a flat rosette, while the outer edge of the lip is decorated with an 'egg and dart' moulding,  normally on the upper part of the outer rim of the lip, with a step down to a plain band below (though this is sometimes reversed). On the body, there are three zones of decoration: the shoulder has broad tongues - which can be flat or modelled - separated from the belly by various arrangements of ridges and incised lines. On the belly is an interlocking pattern of projecting lozenges, which is the most noticable feature of these vessels and very probably linked with depictions of fruit which occur in a parallel series of clay aryballoi in the form of fanciful fruit (Webb 1978, 72, n.5, 108, n.7). Underneath, the decoration is concluded by a flat tongue rosette, which mimics the lip and shoulder decoration. The two examples from Naukratis are fragmentary: one (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, RES 86.136) consists of part of the central lozenge decoration only, while the other (RES.86.135) has part of both the central lozenge and raised rosette decoration above from the shoulder zone. However, it is to be noted that there are other similarly elaborate types of faience aryballoi:  Group II with vertical tongues (Webb 1978, 112-3), and Group III, in undoubted form of fruit (Webb 1978, 113-114), which have similar but not so widespread distribution. Finally, it must also be noted that there is a close relationship with the cartouched aryballoi, which bear the cartouches of Apries,  and which are found in Rhodes, Cyprus, Black Sea and Ibiza. 
 
 Distribution of the class Group I  is overwhelmingly centred on Rhodes, with examples coming from other sites in East Greece, the Black Sea, Cyprus, Al Mina, coast of North Africa, and Italy. An example of an aryballos in the fruit -like form with elongated vertical tongues (Webb Group II, 112-113) was found in excavations at  Memphis, Mit Rahineh, Palace of Merenptah, University of Pennsylvania Museum, Philadelphia. no. ??? unpublished. But they are not commonly found on Egyptian sites. It is the later forms, such as cruder spherical aryballoi, hedgehogs, and other figured vases, which have a more established distribution in Egypt. 
Whether they were actually being manufactured in Rhodes or in Naukratis can not yet be determined. But the initial inspiration is East Greek and stems from the parallel production of clay aryballoi in the form of fruit. 
The interlocking patterns of projecting lozenges degrade into roughly incised diamond patterns in the later groups (Webb 1978, 119-121) and the other elaborate decorative  elements also disappear.
The two examples from Naukratis in Boston may belong to the same vessel, though I think this doubtful. They can be dated to the second quarter of the sixth century (575-550), see the example from a well dated grave from Samos Boehlau, Tomb 44. (Boehlau 1898, pl. 13, 5, p. 160 f; Gercke and Löwe1996, 57-61 no 44, 11, colour pl. 10.)

Numbers on other items in the Kouklia group were interpreted by Walters in his vase catalogue of 1912 as tomb numbers, though not in his earlier terracotta catalogue where the present item was first published. However, no tomb inventories have survived, and the archival sources for the excavations suggest that none were made. 
The fragment is very similar to the head and neck of an askos found in Kouklia-Hasan Agha Tomb 90 dating to the Cypro-Geometric III period which had a bird-shape body, three feet, and a central flaring spout flanked by handles (Georgiou in Hadjisavvas 2010, no. 99: KM 331/1) and to an unprovenanced vessel in Copenhagen ascribed by Gjerstad to Bichrome III (SCE IV/2, fig. XXIV, 6). 
On bird askoi generally see Pieridou 1970; Desborough 1972; Lemos 1994; Koorou 1997. The bird-head askos is believed to originate on Cyprus in the 11th century BC, from where it was introduced to the Aegean world, though there is considerable interplay between the examples found in both areas.

The paper label on the base reading '336 Warren Tamasssus' refers to the exhibition catalogue.  Following his death in Canada in 1910, his executors sold the deposited material to the Trustees for £15 (see GR Trustees Reports, 3 May, 1910; information also in the GR Register for this group). A terracotta figurine, registered as 1910,6-20.22, was returned to the Cyprus Museum a few years later as it had been mistakenly sent to the British Museum with Warren's material. Not everything in the group purchased in 1910 was registered by the British Museum: the duplicate items from Tamassos donated to museum/college collections in the United Kingdom (in Aberystwyth, Dublin, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath and possibly other places) also appear to have come from the original group of items loaned by Warren.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

A few items, namely, the bird vases GR 1881,8-24.47 and 59, may have been found in Mari, if they are the same items mentioned in the Cataogue of the Cyprus Museum (Myres and Ohnefalsch-Richter 1899, 9) as among those excavated there by Ohnefalsch-Richter. Salamis is the most likely provenance for the Hellenisticand Roman material in this registration group given the preponderance of finds of this date among the provenanced items.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

Information kindly provided by Dr Giorgos Georgiou, Department of Antiquities, Cyprus  (e-mail to Thomas Kiely, British Museum, 01/07/2014). Stewart (1962, 226-7) recognised this ware as a variant of the 'standard' north coast RP wares found in the centre and south of the island where it is the predominant RP type. Many examples, including small bowls, have been found at the settlement of Marki-Alonia (Frankel 2006, 105ff and esp.  pp. 108-9 for small bowls) and also at the cemetery of Psematismenos- Trelloukkas on the south coast (Georgiou et al. 2011, 194ff with a discussion of the broader distribution of this type on pp. 202-3). The presence of this type in small quanities at the Vounous and  Karmi sites is an important  indicator of inter-island communications during the Early Cypriot period (Webb et al. 2009,  215-19). See Webb and Frankel 2013 for a broader discussion of this issue and regional variations in material culture, especially ceramics, at this time.

Stewart (1962, 226-7) recognised the ware as a variant of the 'standard' north coast RP wares found in the centre and south of the island where it is the predominant RP type. Many examples, including small bowls, have been found at the settlement of Marki-Alonia (Frankel 2006, 105ff and esp.  pp. 108-9 for small bowls) and also at the cemetery of Psematismenos- Trelloukkas on the south coast (Georgiou et al. 2011, 194ff with a discussion of the broader distribution of this type on pp. 202-3). The presence of this type in small quanities at the Vounous and  Karmi sites is an important  indicator of inter-island communications during the Early Cypriot period (Webb et al. 2009,  215-19).

This is actually an example of Red Polished I-II Mottled ware, a somewhat late version with diagnostic features of the EC II-early ECIII horizon according to G. Georgiou (email correspondence with T. Kiely, Cyprus curator at the British Museum (01/07/2014)). Stewart (1962, 226-7) recognised the ware as a variant of the 'standard' north coast RP wares found in the centre and south of the island where it is the predominant RP type. Many examples, including small bowls, have been found at the settlement of Marki-Alonia (Frankel 2006, 105ff and esp.  pp. 108-9 for small bowls) and also at the cemetery of Psematismenos- Trelloukkas on the south coast (Georgiou et al. 2011, 194ff with a discussion of the broader distribution of this type on pp. 202-3). The presence of this type in small quanities at the Vounous and  Karmi sites is an important  indicator of inter-island communications during the Early Cypriot period (Webb et al. 2009,  215-19). See Webb and Frankel 2013 for a broader discussion of this issue and regional variations in material culture, especially ceramics, at this time.

The description of the discoveries in Site F include pottery of this date and general type (i.e. Bichrome wares) but nothing specifically with this type of decoration (Munro and Tubbs 1891, 146-7). At the same time, this is an example of what Munro and Tubbs recognised as a 'Cypriote Geometric cup', what are now regarded as local imitation of imported Greek Late Geometric wares. Some sherds from terracotta statues allocated to the Fitzwilliam Museum and transferred to the BM in 1909 were also marked with an 'F' and it is possible that the base fragment was recognised as joining the sherds from the same vessel in the BM, in which case the letter refers to the museum and not to archaeological site, so this attribution must be regarded as possible but unconfirmed. 
The vessel as described by Calvet and Yon in GGAPC as Eubean or Cycladic but Coldstream (1979, 263, no. 11) reclassifies it as a local imitation of an Aegean Late Geometric type.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

In terms of shape and decoration, this vessel is similar to decorated bowls with knob-lugs classed by Stewart's as Red Polished II and dated by him between  EC II and MCII (SCE IV/1A, 333), though according to Merrillees and others this more more correctly belong in RP III. Stewart dated the Black Polished variety to the MC I-II period, as have more recent scholars (see Brewster in Frankel and Webb 2007; Webb et al. 2009). Black Polished is largely restricted to the central plain and north-central coastal area of Cyprus, but is generally rare in the Nicosia area. There is a significant occurrence at Dhenia which was probably one of the main production sites of this ware. Its proximity to Nicosia makes it reasonable to suggest that this was a likely source of this item and GR 1888,9-27.18.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31).

Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

Stewart dated the Black Polished variety to the MC I-II period, as have more recent scholars (see Brewster in Frankel and Webb 2007; Webb et al. 2009). 
Black Polished is largely restricted to the central plain and north-central coastal area of Cyprus, but is generally rare in the Nicosia area. There is a significant occurrence at Dhenia which was probably one of the main production sites of this ware. Its proximity to Nicosia makes it reasonable to suggest that this was a likely source of this item and GR 1888,9-27.18.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

Provenance: 
All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

According to the GR Register it was found in tomb 96, but the number 89 is given in Walters' vase catalogue. This has been corrected to '96' in the annotated copy in the GR library. In 'Excavations' however, the illustration of the bowl on fig. 129 is also labelled '89'. In the corresponding tomb lists, the only pottery vessel in Tomb 96 is described: 'Bowl as from tomb 89, with spiral pattern inside, in purple on drab ground' ('Excavations', 80, Tomb 96, no. 1). This could refer to the two shallow bowls decorated with spirals on the interior (one painted, the other incised) listed as items 10 and 11 in the tomb list for Tomb 89 but they are a rather different shape. Furthermore, the paint on the present example is orange-brown rather than purple. 
It is also possible that the the tomb list description is referring to a different example of this type from Tomb 89. However, the only other bowls mentioned in the contents list for Tomb 89 ('Excavations', 80 no. 12), and clearly identified as coming from this burial in the Register and Walters' catalogue, do not match the present example as they are decorated with spirals and chequers arranged in concentric bands (1896,2-1.35) and chevrons and chequers (1896,2-1.36) respectively. The description implies that both have two handles, rather than the single example on the present item. Conversely, the description of the bowl in Tomb 96 seems to imply a single spiral rather than the more complex design of the other examples. 
To add to the confusion, 1896,2-1.35 is attributed to Tomb 96 in fig. 129 of 'Excavations'. Overall, a simpler option is to suggest that the tomb numbers have been accidentally reversed on 'Excavations', Fig. 129. This would solve the attribution problem of the bowl with spirals and chevrons to Tomb 89, but still leave the attribution of the present item open to doubt.          
For other examples of this type see SCE IV/1C, 281-282 (Åström's Wide Bowl type 'd'); many examples are known from Daniel's excavations at Episkopi-Bamboula (Benson 1972, pp. 80 ff).

A few items, namely,  the bird vases GR 1881,8-24.47 and 59, may have been found in Mari, if they  are the same items mentioned in the Cataogue of the Cyprus Museum as  among those excavated there by Ohnefalsch-Richter. Salamis is the most  likely provenance for the Hellenisticand Roman material in this registration  group given the preponderance of finds of this date among the provenanced  items.  
The lack of contextual information makes it difficult to assignt this item a precise date. Ivory and bone boxes were common in Cyprus in both the Late Bronze Age and Hellenistic-Roman periods; this may belong to the latter period given the parallels from Amathus (Chavane 1990, 73), Salamis (Chavane 1975, 176-178 and pls. 48-48) and elsewhere on the island.

Group on a plinth; a bull led to sacrifice by two attendants. Of the first attendant only the right and an onset of the left hand are remaining, placing a twisted garland round the bull's neck; a circular hole in the bull's side might have held the connecting part for the first attendant. The second, behind the first, is placing his right hand on the bull's back; his head is missing.
The bull is slender and its body rather elongated, his dewlaps and hackles are shown as incised parallel folds, the dewlaps merging into a pointy line in the front. An upside-down triangle is marking the forehead, the horns are strong, the rounded ears are turned upward, the large eyes are framed by two layers of skin like eyebrows; the tail resembles a horse's tail. The second attendant is standing to the animal's left, putting his right outstretched arm on the bull's back. His left arm is bent and kept in his matle's sling, the hand is clenched into a fist, the thumb is stretched out. His cloak goes down to his ankles. What is left of his hair is shown as a thick mass with rounded edges, below there is a tounge-like form, which is supposedly the typical folds found on the back. In contrast to the careful rendering of the bull, the attendants are presented rather schematically.
Traces of red paint are remaining on the bull's ears, between nostril and ear, on top of both vessels and on the mantle of the attendant, running from the left wrist to the left shoulder; the directions of the paint on the back is less clear.",,,,,,,Cypro-Archaic II,600BC-550BC (circa),Made in: Cyprus,Excavated/Findspot: Sanctuary of Apollo (Naukratis) (Attributed by Petrie to the 'first temple of Apollo'.),limestone,,type series: Nick Type 3 (Sub group 3.2),painted,"Height: 8 centimetres max ; Length: 9.10 centimetres max ; Width: 5.65 centimetres max ",,"According to Nick (2006, 68-69), this kind of group is not unusual in terracotta statuettes though it is unparalleled in limestone. The material is understood as the reason for differences in presentation and thus explains the lack of close parallels. The garland placed around the bull's neck  clearly indicates a ritual and sacrificial meaning of the group. The accompanying vases and the style of the attendant's garment suggest a date within the first half of the sixth century BC.
The figure bears its registration number and Smith's number 107, the latter in a faint red.

The pilgrim flask, originating in the Late Bronze Age, is a very common Phoenician shape on Cyprus in the CG period (Bikai 1983, 10ff nos 73-113 for numerous examples). The form changes very little during this period, but many of the examples included by Bikai in her chronological analysis belong in her Kouklia Horizon (1050-850 BC).

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

For parallels, SCE IV/1D, p. 525; Peltenburg 1972, pp. 129-136. 
However, what was previously identified as the lower part of the conical cup appears to have a proper edge or rim, in which case the fragment may be from a small stand. Alternatively, the fragment should be inverted and regarded as a flat saucer-like stand on a tall ring- base.

The florid style, including the use of large lotus blossoms, is typical of vase workshops in the east of the island during the Cypro-Archaic period. Karageorghis dated the burials in Salamis Tomb 105 to the very end of CA I, around 600 BC. The flaring neck on both vases hint at developments in the Bichrome V repertoire, in which case the present item may also be ng close in date to that of the provenanced Salamis example.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

The horizontal handles on this vessel are not common in the RP repertoire. An RP vessel with similar handles and shape was found in Ayia Paraskevi Tomb 8a (Kromholz 1982, 38, 115 and fig. XIX). A vessel of comparable shape was found in a tomb excavated in the Ayia Paraskevi cemetery in 2000, classified as RP III and with similar rim projections (see Georgiou 2002, 51 and fig. 1 (Tomb 25, no. 3) with references to further parallels). More recently, a very similar example - with modelled figues on the rim - was found in Tomb 50 (Georgiou 2013, 86 and fig. 6).

Walters, refers to the Catalogue of the Cyprus Museum (Myres and Ohnefalsch-Richer 1899, p. 9) which mentions two vases decorated with birds found in tombs at Mari excavated by Max Ohnefalsch-Richter for the BM in 1881. In his short discussion of these excavations, Reinach mentions among the finds 'une petite oenochoé verte ornée de deux oiseaux d'eau peintes en noir' (1891, 188). The clay of the vase is indeed a greenish hue which seems to correspond to the present vessel. Reinach however mentions only one vase among the few finds described. 
The text of the CCM possibly refers to another bird vase found in a tomb of ancient Kition (modern Larnaca) the same year (GR 1881,8-24.47; BM Vase C817). A similar annotation in the Register also hinted that this might be from Mari but, apart from the fact that it is given Kition as a findspot, the jug is also of a shape, fabric and decorative type quite different from the bird vases made by the 'Amathus Workshop' (see Benson 1982). 
The present jug is attributed by Benson to a specific workshop at Amathus (1982, 140. Phase A, no. 4). On the species, see Benton 1961, pl. II,2.
NB this version of the text was written in March 2017 and should supersede previous comments. The attribution of this vessel to Mari seems assured, while the original attribution of GR 1881,8-24.47 to Kition also seems correct.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

This example has a somewhat deeper bowl than other published examples. The closest parallel in Stewart's classification are his RPIII 'bowls with vertical handles' (2012, 56, XIII M2 type b - the illustrated example from Florence (pl. 5,10) is quite close to the present in shape and also has knobbed decoration - though the generic difference in shape with his M3 group is not that apparent. On this basis, the present item might be later in date than the standard RP I-II mottled types and/or belong in the RP III Mottled tradition.

An example of the smaller variety was found in Amathus BM Tomb 240 (GR 1894,11-1.567). Most examples of this rare ware with firm archaeological contexts date to the CA period but some forms occur earlier.  
The tomb number of the present example is not given in the Register. At least three tombs contained jugs that seem to correspond to this type. The example in Tomb 140, to judge by the sketch in the notebook, is closer in shape and size (apparently around 6 to 9 cm) to GR 1894,1-1.567 from Tomb 240. Another was found in Tomb 158 (also with a squat body so closer to GR 1894,11-1.567 but with a neck-ridge similar to the present example); however, since at least part of the Tomb 158 group was allocated to the Cyprus Museum, the jug itself is unlikely to be the present example. Finally, the jug sketched in the notebook entry for Tomb 252 is also closer to the squat examples than to the present item, though it should be noted that Myres' sketches were not always very accurate in terms of the shapes of the items he drew.

Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

The following item in the catalogue sequence is from Yeri though the entry for C326 also says it was found with C561. It is possible that all three vessels were found together, though the chronological difference between two late MC items and one from the LCIIB or early LCIIC suggests that the tomb was used on a number of occasions. This is attested at several tombs in the cemeteries of Nicosia-Ayia Paraskevi (Kromholz 1982; Merrillees 2012) while a number of burial grounds in the centre of the island (but also Klavdhia-Tremithos) also continued in use across the MC to LC transition.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

Form: Åström described BS V as a Late Cypriot development of BS III, though the difference is not always clear independently of an archaeological context as the the two fabrics are indistinguishable. (Note that this vessel was originally assigned to BS III in the annotated copy of Walters' catalogue held in the GR Department). Merrillees, who adds several examples and further details to Åström's corpus, traces the form to el-Lisht and Tell el-Yahudia ware bird- and fish-shaped vessels. As such, he argues that the Cypriot imitations could not be an earlier than LCIA and are likely to be dated to this period.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

Apart from saying that it came from Nicosia-Ayia Paraskevi, he does not detail the circumstances under which it was found or its location. Either he excavated or collected it for Warren or else studied it when it was in the latter's collection. The former suggestion is more likely, in which case it can be suggested that all of the material in sequence GR 1888,9-27 was excavated by OR for Warren.        
For the type and parallels, see SCE IV/1C, 127-8 (PBR Type 1 C 1 a) and p. 149 (BR I Type V I D 1 b). The snake heads may symbolise rejuvenation or rebirth, which would be appropriate if the juglet contained an opium-based product used as a medicine or simply a perfumed oil to revive the senses. This has been suggested on account of the shape of the vessel - it resembles a poppy head when inverted - but this has not yet been confirmed by scientific analysis of the few vessels of this type which retain their contents.

These included more parts of the frame and fringed motifs in the 'windows' on the right side of Side A, the second full-height woman on the left side of Side B, and parts of the handle. The BM fragments were loaned to the Cyprus Museum in August 1969 (Trustees Minute, 12 October 1968) where they were brought together with those from Benson's excavations in a more complete reconstruction of the crater.

Falkland Warren over the vase, see Ohnefalsch-Richter 1893, 36-7 and 38 note *, figs 37-8. The latter stated that the crater was found, with its foot missing, in a 'deep earth-tomb', but provides no further details (1893, 38 note *). Reinach added that it was found in a very deep pit accessed by a 'galerie ou couloir' (presumably a dromos of some description) closed by a wall composed of small stones (Reinach 1891, 265). See Buchholz et al 2010, 217ff for a detailed account of the cemetery in which the vase was found, including other tombs discovered in 1885, together with a discussion of the vase (with full references) on pp 396-402 and pls 214-17.  
See Ohnefalsch-Richter 1893, 62-3 and figs 71, 75 on the iconography. Reinach also provides an important early account, including illustrations of the vessel before it was damaged during restoration (Reinach 1891, 294-300). The scene on Side B was originally interpreted as Perseus slaying the Gorgon (see Masson 1964, 297) but is more likely to represent a fighting scene complementing the chariot group on Side A (see discussion in Karageorghis and des Gagniers 1971; also Karageorghis 1966, 102-4 and fig. 1). Hermary sees the scene as heroic in nature, perhaps related to 'Homeric' epic (1991, 174-5 and passim for an important modern survey of the vessel).

See Karageorghis 1983, 364 for an overview and passim for specific instances. Skales Tomb 44 contained no fewer than seven examples and Kouklia-Plakes tomb 143 produced three (Karageorghis and Raptou 2014, nos 9, 19 and 45). The Proto White Painted and early White Pained/Bichrome examples, richly decorated with geometric motifs, can be fairy precisely dated by this criterion alone, though the simpler banded decoration on stands found in the same deposits - and on the present example - are harder to place without a specific context. For example, three of the five stands in Skales Tomb 45, though somewhat squatter, have similar horizontal bands to the present example (nos 26, 31 and 59). They are assigned to Bichrome I by the excavator, but this is based partly on their association with SCE group I ceramic items. At the same time, an 11-cm high amphoriskos in White Painted III ware in Tomb 81 (no. 13) sits on a tripod support similar to the present example.

A note in the margin of the register however notes the similarity of this item with a sketch in Myres tomb notebook entry for Tomb 187. However a similar type of juglet is attributed to this tomb group in the Cyprus Museum (Myres and Ohnefalsch-Richter 1899, no. 1096) which therefore seems to be the correct findspot. Tomb 187 is also mentioned in the CM catalogue (no. 1092) in relation to a strainer-spout from a jug found here (also listed in Myres' tomb notebook). Confusingly, the entry implies that the spout is in the BM (but unfortunately gives a reference to a version of the Cypriot vase catalogue superceded by Walters' 1903 catalogue for which there is no known concordance). There is no trace of such a spout in the BM collection to confirm that the tomb group was in fact split between the two institutions.

Salamis is the most likely provenance for the Hellenisticand Roman material in this registration group given the preponderance of finds of this date among the provenanced items.  
The lack of information on the archaeological context makes precise dating uncertain. Cylindrical boxes made of bone or ivory and bone were common on Cyprus from the Late Bronze Age down to Hellenistic and Roman times, with little change in the simpler examples (see SCE IV/1D, fig. 74, 24-5; SCE IV/2, fig. 41, 20; SCE IV/3). Parallels from excavated contexts at Amathus (Chavane 1990, 73 and pl. XVII), Salamis (Chavane 1975, 176-8 and pls. 48-9 and 70-1) and elsewhere suggest a Hellenistic or Roman date for this type.

Her hair is short, but looped up, and has a fillet wound irregularly around it. From left to right is inscribed, Ήρας καλή.
This figure is drawn on a larger scale, and with a coarser effect than that of a.
Strong style. Drawing of a good, of b very coarse. Purple inscriptions, and fillet in b. The rays of the stephane in a are engraved. No inner markings. Eye in a of archaic type with both angles open; in b of transition type with large black disk as pupil.

Possibly the woman in b may be the personification of Asia, as in the Darius vase, Mon. dell’ Inst, ix, pl. 50-51. The object held by Athene is not the usual form of aphlaston; it may be the Άκρα κορνμβα, see Torr, Ancient Ships, p. 68, note 152. Nike holds it on BM Vases Β 608-9; compare the design on a sard scaraboid from Cyprus in the British Museum; also Millingen, Anc. Uned. Mon. pl. 29; and the description by Pausanias (v, 11, 5) of the figure of Salamis holding τον έτί ταίς ναυσιν ακραίε ποιούμενον κόσμον. For the various interpretations suggested and the form of name, see Arch. Zeit. loc. cit. Keil, Anal. Epig. p. 171, suggests that Ήρας is a contracted form for Ήραΐς.","Vase / Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum; Old Catalogue / A Catalogue of the Greek and Etruscan Vases in the British Museum; CVA British Museum 5 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 7, British Museum 5",On display (G15/dc3),,,classical deity,Representation of: Athena/Minerva,,,,Purchased from: Edmé Antoine Durand (sale); Purchased through: Peter Oluf Brøndsted,,,,1836,,,Greek and Roman,,"1836,0224.13",,,

A later annotation, probably by H.B. Walters, suggested that the item might be one of the jugs decorated with birds found by Ohnefalsch-Richter at Mari in 1881 (referring to Myres and Ohnefalsch-Richter 1899, 9) but there the text is somewhat sceptical on this point. Reinach's account, written in 1885 and based on information from O-R himself, is more likely to be correct. Conversely, Reinach's comments on the finds from Mari (1891, 188) make it likely that the other bird vase in the GR 1881,8-24 sequence (no. 59) is from this site based on the description of the clay.   
The present item was found in a tomb in the Ayios Ioannis area in the north-west part of the historic town of Larnaca (Reinach 1891, 175). See Nicolaou 1976, 169-181 and fig. 10 for other tombs in this cemetery found in more recent times. Also Fourrier 2015 for a more recent overview of the topography of the site.    
NB this version of the text was written in March 2017 and should supersede previous comments. The attribution of this vessel to Kition seems assured, while the original attribution of GR 1881,8-24.59 to Mari also now seems correct.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

Reuse/continued use of tombs across the MC to LC period has also been observed in Nicosia (Merrillees 2012 for a tomb excavated by Ohnefalsch-Richter; Kromholz 1982, Tombs 6 and 15). This is also one of the very first Mycenaean vessels from Cyprus to have been recorded in situ.

XXIV for similar protomes on a Bichrome III ring vase; this may also be related to the later protome vases of CA II date (see Vandenabeele 1998, chapter II) or to vases with anthropomorphic elements vase (see Nys 1997). These may also be related to figurines found on wall plaques, some of which were holders for lamps or incense burners (see J. and V. Karageorghis 2006, who discuss the identity of the figurines which may be deities, especially Hathor). The identification of the head on the present example as Hathor is less certain, as it lacks the familiar upcurling locks, though more correctly this is probably an image of the local Great Goddess than Hathor herslef.

However, no list of the tombs has survived and, according to a letter written by Percy Christian to A.S. Murray, none of the burials discovered was sufficiently intact or interesting to warrent making one. It is possible that Francis Welch made notes that were shared with the British Museum, but there is no indicaiton of this in his short report to the British Museum preseved in the GR archives (both documents bound in Excavations in Cyprus: Correspondence).     
This shape originates in the Proto-White Painted ware repertoire of the 11th century BC (see Pieridou 1973, 14, Type 2 and pls. 6-11 - examples from Kourion and Lapithos -  and Karageoghis 1975, G1 (from Gastria-Alaas)). Numerous examples of this basic type, with variations in the form of the loop handle, have been found in Cypro-Geometric Tombs at Palaepaphos excavated by the Department of Antiquities in modern times, the best documented of which are those from the cemetery of Skales (e.g. Tombs 44, no. 85; Tomb 45, no. 53; Tomb 48A, no. 4 (pedestalled bowl); Tomb 51, no. 22; Tomb 67, nos 94 and 151) though none of these examples have the divided loop handle of the present example. The motif on the underside is also employed on more regular two-handled shallow bowls/plates, many of which occur in the Skales tombs and which is typical of local production (see Smith 2009, 238-40 and pl. VII.1 with refs).

This may be true in some instances, but both - and especially Luigi - made extensive use of agents across the island who dug on their behalf or else collected items from the local antiquity market (itself spurred by the growing demand for ancient artafects by individuals such as the Cesnolas). This practice casts doubt on the provenance assigned to items which in some cases is demonstrably false or misleading - most notoriously in the case of the so-called Curium Treasure which Luigi assembled from tombs (and perhaps shrines) of different periods in the Kourion area.",Greek and Roman,,"1876,0909.24",,,

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

The shape is that of the ordinary sarcophagus. The rounding of the top of the headpiece is modern: according to Dennis the fragment had been reused for building (AD i, 34).
For the boy and dogs compare closely Istanbul 1352, which is by the same hand (Johansen, Acta Arch xiii, 41-47, fig. 27). The Istanbul sarcophagus has also the framing band, rosettes - though of different antecedents - in the upper corner strip, and the chequering below the upper panel; but these appear on other early sarcophagi. Satyrs painted in white are frequent blazons of shields in the Albertinum group; those always have human feet, perhaps in deference to Attic. But this hooved satyr looks back to his older relations on Clazomenian black figure pots (see BSA xlvii, 142 n. 87). So, much more obviously, do the large cockerels (cf., for example, Pl. 587, 16-17).
The headpiece is decorative both in arrangement and intention. The central figure, as Johansen has explained admirably, is excerpted from the Attic group, familiar in the mid and later sixth century, of the man who woos his boy friend with the gift of a cockerel (From the Collections iii, 134-40; and on these scenes generally see J. D. Beazley, Some Attic Vases in the Cyprus Museum, 18-24). The doubling of the cockerels, though authorized by Attic, is necessary here for decorative symmetry; and the dogs and flanking poultry are more or less appropriate filling. A similar grouping of a boy holding a small cockerel and a large cockerel beside him can be made out on an earlier Clazomenian black figure potsherd (Pl. GB 588, 5). There is, of course, no need or excuse for a chthonic interpretation of this headpiece, nor yet of the satyr of the upper panel.
This is evidently an early sarcophagus. Its not very competent painter, whether he drew directly on Attic or not, was partly dependent on the Borelli painter. Johansen proposes a date in the 530's (Acta Arch xiii, 45-47); but some of his parallels are dated perhaps a little too early and he makes no allowance for lag.

Aphrodite and a young hunter (Adonis?). In the centre, Aphrodite (flesh coloured white) is seated on raised ground to left, with a mantle over her legs, leaning on her left hand; her face and right arm are missing; she wears a radiated fillet, necklace of beads, and bracelets. Confronting her on left is seated a youth in a chlamys and a Phrygian cap, resting his left hand on the end of his club, the head of which rests on the ground beside him; his left elbow is placed in the hollow between the branch and trunk of a tree which springs from the ground on his left. His face, which is broken away, seems to be turned to the front. Behind Aphrodite, Eros flies towards her, and appears to be clasping her round the neck; his face is damaged; he wears a fillet. On the right is a group of two women: one is seated on raised ground, and holds out in her right hand to left a wreath of laurel (part missing), of which her left hand probably held the other end. Behind her stands a woman who rests one hand on either shoulder of the seated figure; her drapery flies back as if she were in quick movement, though her feet are together. On the left a third woman stands looking to right, leaning forward with left knee raised, and resting her left elbow in another hollow of the tree. All the women wear a long chiton tied, earrings, necklace, and bracelets, and their hair is knotted high with a fillet. In the ground, branches of laurel spring up.

Also registered with this object was a silver coin of Idalion dating 'slightly before 500 B.C.' according to the register (1887,8-1.3) and a silver boss from a shield (1887,8-1.3). The comments in the register state that the tomb also contained 'gold cups, with acorns repoussé; electrum ring with engraving of boat of the sun; large bronze vessel; many black figure vases; no red figd. vases...and additional items'. Photographs of some of these are included in an album entitled 'Misc. Photographs II' in the Greek and Roman Department archive.
For the excavations in 1886 see Ohneflsch-Richter 1893 passim; the main analytic account sis P Herrmann 1888, Das Gräberfeld von Marion auf Cypern (Berlin). Many of the contents of the 441 tombs opened during this campaign were sold in Paris in 1887, though the finds in the BM were directly through Charles Christian, one of the archaeological syndicate.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

All of the items in the sequence 1868,9-5.1-57 appear to be from the excavations in the Dali area in the early part of 1868, mentioned by Pierides in his letter to Newton dated 21 Feb. 1868 (Original Letters 1861-68, no. 590; see also Letter Book 1861-79, 1868 nos 16, 27 and 31). Pierides gives no details of the findspot(s) of the pottery which ranges in date from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages down to Cypro-Archaic times. Robert Hamilton Lang however relates that the initial focus of tomb digging around Dali this year took place at the base of a hill north of the village (with a well at the top known as Laksha Nicoli). It is not clear from his further observation that the local population then began to dig on a very large scale, if other cemeteries around Dali were also excavated at this time. His account implies however that the initial area of discovery was the one in which he and his colleagues - Pierides, Ceccaldi, Sandwith and Cesnola - concentrated their own digging activities (Lang 1878, 331-3), though it is quite likely that in addition all of these individuals purchased items from the local population. This might explain the chronological range of the Pierides group, though it is possible that the later material came from older cemeteries or tombs reused in the first millennium BC, if not from more than one site.

There are numerous views as to the identification of this ware. It is described as Late Cycladic  by Forsdyke in BMC Vases A390, but as a fragment of a Late Minoan IA vase by Bailey in HST I. Åström somewhat ambitiously ascribed it to Furumark Shape 281, despite the small size of the sherd.

According to a marginal note in the BM Catalogue, the sherd joins B1223 from Tomb 13 of the University of Pennsylvania Expedition to Kourion (Benson 1972, 122) and a vase illustrated by Daniel in the Bulletin of the Pennsylvania University Museum 8 (1940), pl. IV. f, where it is described as as a possible 'Syrian variety of Base Ring ware'. Note however that B1223 is listed in Benson 1972 as an unstratified fragment from Area A.
