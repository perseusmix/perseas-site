Transliteration after Masson 1966. The text is described as Eteo-Cypriot because it cannot be read and even the beginning of the text is uncertain (Masson 1966, 28).	The alabastron was discovered or collected by Luigi Palma di Cesnola but ended up in Lang's personal collection where it remained until 1903. When Lang left Cyprus in 1872, he gave around 1500 fragmentary items to Cesnola in exchange for a dozen pieces of high quality (BM GR archives, Original Letters 1869-72, vol. 2). This is possibly one of these exchanges, though it was commonplace for the antiquarian community to give or swap items from their excavations and collections, and Lang says that he ceded Cesnola the right to excavate at Golgoi so he may have been given items from the site before this time.  
The inscription was published in various places since its discovery: by Cesnola (1877, pl. IV, 17); Cesnola 1885-1903, III, Supplement, pl. CXLI, no. 15; Schmidt 1874, 100; Schmidt 1876, 7 and pl. XIX, 1; Hall 1885,  226ff. See also Mitford 1961, p. 45 no. 30.

The lip of the vase and nose of the woman are broken away. The upper part  of the alabastron is terminating in the bust of a woman on top of whose head  the vase's lip was placed. The figure is wearing a thin veil, falling over the hair and shoulders towards the front; the ears are covered. The face is rather rounded with slim, fairly long, oblique, the lower lid is more or  less straight, the upper plastically rendered. The mouth is smiling broadly  with full lips; the nose is short (and chipped). The back is left round. Only top part preserved; black substance sticking to neck.

Four examples are known from Naukratis (Bolton Museum 1966.112.A), two from the sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts Ξ¦8 and  Ξ¦10; Boston 88.738; British Museum GR1888,0601.15; Gardner 1888, pl.

All three contexts are late Saite in date. They were likely made in the same workshop (HΓ¶ckmann 2007, 190 ). Parallels (Maximova 1927, 128, no.1; Poulsen 1912, 99; J. Paul Getty Museum no.

Two old Egyptian Department registration numbers are written on the body of the vessel (98333 on the neck and, more faintly, 89330 between the lugs).							Cypro-Archaic II; Cypro-Classical	600BC-400BC	Made in: Cyprus	Excavated/Findspot: Golgoi	limestone; alabaster			ground; polished; incised	Height: 29.50 centimetres; Length: 5 centimetres inscription ; Weight: 610 grammes; Width: 5 centimetres	Inscription type: inscription Inscription language: Eteocypriot Inscription script: Classical Cypriot Syllabary Inscription transliteration: ti-pa-?-i-wo-to-te/ ti-to-wo-i-?-pa-ti Inscription note: Masson restored seven signs but the last element, adjacent to the lug, is not particularly clear. Neither the direction of the script nor the linguistic affinity of the text could be established by Masson but it appears to be definitely not Greek and has therefore been defined as Eteo-Cypriot by default (Masson 1966, 29).	Two old Egyptian Department registration numbers are written on the body of the vessel (98333 on the neck and, more faintly, 89330 between the lugs).
The alabastron was discovered or collected by Luigi Palma di Cesnola but ended up in personal Lang's collection where it remained until 1903. When Lang left Cyprus in 1872, he gave around 1500 fragmentary items to Cesnola in exchange for a dozen pieces of high quality (BM GR archives, Original Letters 1869-72, vol. 2). This is possibly one of these exchanges, through it was commonplace for the antiquarian community to give or swap items from their excavations and collections, and Lang says that he ceded Cesnola the right to excavate at Golgoi so he may have been given items from the site before this time

Made of fine buff-orange clay with a white slip or ground, decorated with black and yellow; vessel restored from fragments and reconstructed in places (especially parts of the lower body).  
Above and below the figural scene are tongues painted in black, on the bottom a rosette in red on black; on either side of the vase an ear in red. The pictorial scene shows a Bacchic ceremony. On the left is a Maenad to right, with hair in a tuft at the back, and a yellow plume (?), long yellow chiton and white himation over her shoulders, holding out a phiale in left hand. Before her is a crane to right, painted black, with yellow feathers on head and breast. On the right is a Maenad rushing towards the other, with sphendone and cap over her hair, chiton and himation as the other, sandals, and nebris tied at the neck, holding a laurel-branch in either hand. Around the flask just below the shoulder is an inscription in Greek alphabetic script naming Pasiades as the potter; around the mouth proclaims 'the boy is handsome [kalos]'.

The lip of the vase and nose of the woman are broken away. The upper part of the alabastron is terminating in the bust of a woman on top of whose head the vase's lip was placed. The figure is wearing a long-sleeved garment and a thin veil, falling over the hair and shoulders towards the front; the ears are not covered and the veil might as well be a wig-like hairstyle. She is wearing a necklace which is falling down to her breasts which she clasps with her right hand; alternatively it has been suggested that she is holding another object thus covering the necklace. The left arm is hanging at the side, the fingers are clenched with the thumb projecting. The face is rather rounded with a pointed chin. The slim oblique eyes are fairly long, the lower lid is more or less straight, the upper plastically rendered. The mouth is smiling broadly with full lips; the nose is short with a broadening tip. The back is left round.							Cypro-Archaic II	575BC-550BC (circa)	Made in: Cyprus (?)

Upper part of an alabastron in the shape of a woman. Preserved from the lip down to below the right elbow; the lip is damaged, the back of the nose broken away. The woman is wearing a long-sleeved garment which is combined with a veil leaving the ears uncovered and falling over the shoulders towards the front. The left arm is hanging down at the side, the right is angled with the clenched hand with the horizontally pointing thumb resting right below the pointy breasts. Indications of jewellery are missing but were possibly painted onto the surface. Therather plump face has slim flat eyes and a small, slightly smiling mouth. The entire surface is worn.

At some point from 1912 onwards, its BM vase catalogue number seems to have been added to the wrong entry in the GR 1894,11-1. sequence. This was corrected by Don Bailey in 1978 who assigned it the current registration number by adding it to the end of the 1894 sequence.		Greek and Roman		18,941,101.74

Made of fine buff clay decorated with black paint: apart from the human head, there are vertical bands on the body and handles.							Cypro-Archaic II	600 BC-450 BC	Made in: Cyprus	Excavated/Findspot: Kouklia	pottery			painted; wheel-made	Height: 9 centimetres	Inscription type: inscription Inscription script: Cypriot Syllabic Inscription transliteration: pi- ?- ? - se Inscription note: According to Massimo Perna (e-mail of October 2015), the first character on the left is a 'pi' and the last a 'se' but the two characters in between are uncertain. The 'se' might represent the genitive ending of a word, such as a name, in which case this could be a possessive formula indicating ownership or dedication (e.g. I belong to X, a human or a deity).	Walters' catalogue of vases assigned this item to Tomb 17, possibly based on a number written on the object that is no longer visible. However, no inventory of tombs has survived and the archival sources preserved in the Department of Greece and Rome suggest that none was ever made. Furthermore, the numbers written on the three terracotta figures found in the same tomb in 1899 (GR 1899,12-29.1-3) are all different - respectively 4, 9 and 21 (i.e. two numbers on one object), and 2 - and clearly do not represent tomb tombs.

Cypro-Geometric III; Cypro-Geometric II	950BC-750BC	Made in: Cyprus	Excavated/Findspot: Kition	pottery	White Painted Ware (WP II)		painted; slipped; wheel-made	Height: 15 centimetres max 		Part of the same vessel as GR 1881,8-24.51 (BM Vase C858). It was was found in a tomb the Ayios Ioannis area in the north-west part of the historic town of Larnaca (Reinach 1891, 175). See Nicolaou 1976, 169-181 and fig. 10 for other tombs in this cemetery found in more recent times. Also Fourrier 2015 for a more recent overview of the topography of the town. 
See the comments of the excavator Max Ohnefalsch-Richter (1893, pl. 155,9). Benton (1961, 50 and pl. IV,3) identified the birds as turtle-doves and the square structure as a flower pot, not an altar as stated in the BM Vase Catalogue.
